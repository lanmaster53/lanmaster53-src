> **prac·ti·cal**: of or concerned with the actual doing or use of something rather than with theory and ideas.

There are plenty of resources for theory and ideas regarding the many fields of study within the Information Security industry. The missing piece to many of these great resources and the brilliant discoveries we read about on a daily basis is the practical application to our daily jobs. Tim Tomes, the founder of Practical Security Services, spent his career focusing on stripping away the "magic" from these complex theories and ideas and finding ways to make them applicable to what professionals in the Information Security industry do every day. So out of that approach was born the idea of forming a company whose goal is the same. To provide consulting, development, and training services where the practical application of technologies, theories, and ideas result in a high-quality, actionable deliverable and an enhanced skill set.
