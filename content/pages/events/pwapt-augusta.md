###### Description

Headed to Augusta, GA for [BSidesAugusta](http://bsidesaugusta.org/)? If not, you should be! With Fort Gordon, home of NSA South and the Army Cyber branch, only a few miles away, Augusta is a fast growing Information Security community and host to one of the largest BSides events in the world. While the conference has historically been a huge success, it's done so without offering training opportunities. Not anymore! This year [BSidesAugusta](http://bsidesaugusta.org/) is partnering with Practical Security Services to bring you a 3-day presentation of Practical Web Application Penetration Testing (PWAPT) with Tim "lanmaster53" Tomes. For specific details regarding course materials and prerequisites, see the [PWAPT training page](/training).
