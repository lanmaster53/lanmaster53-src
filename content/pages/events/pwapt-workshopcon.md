###### Description

Practical Security Services (PractiSec) is thrilled to be partnering with [WorkshopCon](https://twitter.com/WorkshopCon) alongside [SpecterOps](https://specterops.io/) to bring you the inaugural WorkshopCon! PractiSec's portion of the event is a 3-day presentation of Practical Web Application Penetration Testing (PWAPT) with Tim "lanmaster53" Tomes. This is not your average PWAPT offering. In addition to world class training, you'll be provided breakfast, lunch, and afternoon refreshments in a top notch training facility, and the opportunity to network with and learn from other professionals across the industry. Students and trainers are encouraged to use breaks and down time to expand their social network and share additional knowledge. For specific details regarding course materials and prerequisites for PWAPT, see the [PWAPT training page](/training).
