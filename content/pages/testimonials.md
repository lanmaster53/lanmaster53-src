> "I just completed my first paid pen test as an after hours gig. Thanks to your class, I had a solid methodology to follow. I went down the list and it went better than I expected. I found stored XSS, IDOR, Session Fixation, insecure JWT storage, CSRF and more. I would have never been able to do this without you. Thank you so much. I can’t wait to take the class again!!" - Joe S. (PWAPT WorkshopCon, 2019)

> "This is the most beneficial, real-world applicable course I have ever attended on web application penetration testing. In three days, Tim walked us through his expert methodology on assessing web applications and provided insight on the most recent vulnerabilities that are currently being found and how to test for them. Excellent course." - Steve D. (PWAPT Raleigh, 2019)

> "I've been in IT for 24 years and have taken dozens and dozens of training classes. I've left most of those classes feeling like the value of the class for the cost wasn't worth it. That was completely the opposite for your class. I left wondering why it was so cheap. Without a doubt it was some of the best training I've received in my career." - Jeremy Archer (PWAPT Eau Claire, 2018)

> "I've taken several different trainings/certifications to include: OSCP, eMAPT, ePPT, Sans (GCFE and GMOB); your training and method of instruction blew these away. You've given me the gift of knowledge and I greatly appreciate it!" - DJ Phishes (PWAPT Eau Claire, 2018)
